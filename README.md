# NewsProfileApp

## Overview

NewsProfileApp is a user profile page similar to Instagram but for a news application. This profile page allows users to view their personal information, posted articles, and bookmarked or liked news stories. The application is built using React, React Router, and a CSS framework like Bootstrap, emphasizing user experience and interface design.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript and React concepts (components, state, props)
- Familiarity with React for web development
- Basic knowledge of React Router for navigation between screens
- Understanding of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling and layout

## Project Setup

1. Initialize a new React project named NewsProfileApp.
2. Install React Router for managing navigation between pages.
3. Choose a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Profile Page Design

- User Information Section: Display the user's avatar, name, and a short bio. Use appropriate HTML elements and CSS classes for styling.
- Tabs for Content Organization: Implement tabs or segmented controls to separate the user's posted news articles and their bookmarked/liked stories. Use React Router for page navigation or a tab component from a CSS framework.
- News Cards: For each article under the posted and bookmarked sections, display a card with the article's title, an excerpt, and a thumbnail image. Use appropriate HTML and CSS for the card layout.
- Settings Icon: Include an icon that navigates to a settings page (the settings page implementation is beyond this assignment's scope but prepare the navigation).

## Functionality

- Navigation: Use React Router to move between the profile page and other dummy pages (e.g., a home page and a settings page) to demonstrate navigation capability.
- Mock Data: Since the focus is on the UI, you can use static data to represent the user information and articles. Create a JSON file with dummy data that includes user information and a list of articles.

## Styling

- Use CSS to style your application, including layout, colours, typography, etc.
- Customize the appearance of your tabs and cards to mimic a modern news application. You may choose a colour scheme that suits a new context.

## Extra Challenges (Optional)

- Implement a dark mode toggle in the settings screen and apply dark mode styles throughout the profile page.
- Use an API like NewsAPI to fetch real news articles instead of using static data, displaying them in the posted and bookmarked tabs.

## Deliverables

- Source code of the NewsProfileApp project, including all the React code, assets, and any additional libraries used.
- A README file with instructions on how to run the application, a brief description of the project, and screenshots of the profile page.
- Ensure the application is responsive and looks appealing on different screen sizes and devices.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality: The app runs without errors, and all requirements are met.
- Code Quality: Code is well-organized, commented, and follows best practices.
- UI/UX Design: The profile page is user-friendly, visually appealing, and provides a smooth navigation experience.
- Creativity and Effort: Demonstrated through additional features, UI design, and how effectively CSS framework components are utilised.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit your project by pushing the code to a GitHub repository and share the link via email at hiring@thebharat.news.
- Ensure the repository is public or shared with your instructor.
- Include any setup instructions or prerequisites in the README file.
